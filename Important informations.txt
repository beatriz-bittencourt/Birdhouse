University project using web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), Linux and Arduino.


Birdhouse is a website to control some things in an automatic cage, including: downloading bird movement (entrances and exits), establishing feeding schedules and answering questions about food, the birds and the cage.


***IMPORTANT
For the project to work 100% correctly, you need Arduino codes that complement and provide practical functionality, as well as Arduino parts. However, these codes are not completely ready and currently I can no longer access the Arduino parts to completely finish the project.

**The web part is practically ready and fully responsive for use. If you want to use it, give credits ;)
